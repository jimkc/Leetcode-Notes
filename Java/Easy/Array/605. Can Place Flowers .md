## Question
You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
</pre>


Constraints:

    1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104
    flowerbed[i] is 0 or 1.
    There are no two adjacent flowers in flowerbed.
    0 <= n <= flowerbed.length


## Thinking
###Why is greedy the right solution here?
In this specific problem of placing flowers in a flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule, the local optimal choices lead to a global optimal solution because of the way the problem is structured and the constraints it imposes. Let's break down why this is the case:

1. **No Adjacent Flowers Constraint**: The problem enforces a constraint that no two flowers can be planted in adjacent plots. This constraint is crucial in understanding why the local optimal choices lead to a global optimal solution.

2. **Greedy Choice Based on Constraint**: The greedy approach in this problem focuses on making choices that satisfy the constraint of no adjacent flowers. At each step, we place a flower in an empty plot only if the previous and next plots are also empty. This local decision-making process ensures that we never violate the adjacent flowers rule.

3. **Maximizing Flower Placement**: By following the local rule of placing flowers while avoiding adjacent flowers, we ensure that we utilize the available plots as efficiently as possible. This means we're placing as many flowers as possible in the available space.

4. **No Need for Reconsideration**: Once a flower is placed, it stays in its position, and subsequent decisions are made based on the current state of the flowerbed. There's no need to reconsider or backtrack on previous flower placements.

5. **Global Optimality**: Because of the constraint of no adjacent flowers, there's no way to rearrange the flowers later to achieve a better solution. Once a locally optimal decision is made at each step, it contributes to the globally optimal arrangement, where the maximum number of flowers are placed while adhering to the adjacent flowers constraint.

It's important to note that the local optimal leading to global optimal property doesn't hold for all problems. It works here due to the specific structure of the problem and the constraints it involves. In other problems, the local optimal may not guarantee a global optimal solution due to different constraints or characteristics. Therefore, it's always important to analyze the problem's constraints, characteristics, and structure to determine if a greedy approach is suitable and if the local optimal choices indeed lead to a globally optimal solution.

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canPlaceFlowers(int[] flowerbed, int n) {
        if (n == 0) return true;
        int count = 0;
        int i = 0;

        while (i < flowerbed.length)
        {
            if (flowerbed[i] == 0)
            {
                boolean prevEmpty = (i == 0) || (flowerbed[i-1] == 0);
                boolean nextEmpty = (i == flowerbed.length -1) || (flowerbed[i+1] == 0);

                if( prevEmpty && nextEmpty )
                {
                    flowerbed[i] = 1;

                    n--;
                    if(n == 0) return true;
                }
            }
            i++;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
