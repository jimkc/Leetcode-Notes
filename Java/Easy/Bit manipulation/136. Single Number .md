## Question
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
</pre>

Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
    -3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
    Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.


## Thinking

Here's a breakdown of how XOR operates:

If Input A is 0 and Input B is 0, XOR returns 0.
If Input A is 0 and Input B is 1, XOR returns 1.
If Input A is 1 and Input B is 0, XOR returns 1.
If Input A is 1 and Input B is 1, XOR returns 0.

Using Bit Manipulation -

    As we know XOR operation with 0 gives the same number
    i.e, a XOR 0 = a
    eg, for decimal no. 2=> 2 XOR 0 = 2
    in binary, 010 XOR 000 = 010

    Also we know that , XOR operation with same number gives 0
    i.e, a XOR a = 0
    eg, 2 XOR 2 = 0
    in binary, 010 XOR 010 = 000

    XOR is associative (like sum)
    i.e, (2 XOR 3) XOR 4 = 2 XOR (3 XOR 4), So the order doesn't matter in performing XOR operation.
    eg, 2^3^4^6 = 3^2^6^4 = 4^2^6^3 ......

So, using these three properties of XOR , we will solve the question. we will take ans variable with 0 as initial value.   
And then for each element i in array, we will perform the XOR operation of the element with 0,   
ans will become 0 if the same number is found (as a XOR a = 0) and so after the completion of the loop,   
only element with no duplicate number will remain and will be returned as ans.

Time: O(n)

Space: O(n)

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] countBits(int n) {
        int[] dp = new int[n+1];
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int i=1; i<n+1; i++)
        {
            // i & 1 has same result as i % 2
            dp[i] = dp[i >> 1] + (i & 1);
        }
        return dp;
    }
}
```
