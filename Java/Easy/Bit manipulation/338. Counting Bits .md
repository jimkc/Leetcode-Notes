## Question
Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: n = 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
3 --> 11
4 --> 100
5 --> 101
</pre>

Constraints:

    0 <= n <= 105

Follow up:

    It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of O(n log n). Can you do it in linear time O(n) and possibly in a single pass?
    Can you do it without using any built-in function (i.e., like __builtin_popcount in C++)?


## Thinking
When it comes to even numbers, i.e, 2,4,6,8, their binary should be like '10', '100', '110', '1000' so one notable difference is their unit digit is always 0, which means when you call >> 1- shift one bit rightwards and also means dividing by 2- would cause no change to the count of '1' in the binary string.

Vice versa, when you meet odd numbers, shifting one bit rightwards always eliminates one '1' digit from original binary string, that is why we should "compensate" one '1' character to the count.

To sum up, when you meet even number the count of '1's is always the same as its half number, on the other hand, remember to plus one to the odds' half number.

The last digit of 1 or 0, which is " i&1 " is equivalent to " i%2 ". Because you can write 1 in bit as ...0001 and when it & with any number it will be eiter 0 or 1.

## Coding
Time: O(n)

Space: O(n)

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] countBits(int n) {
        int[] dp = new int[n+1];
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int i=1; i<n+1; i++)
        {
            // i & 1 has same result as i % 2
            dp[i] = dp[i >> 1] + (i & 1);
        }
        return dp;
    }
}
```
