## Question
Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1
</pre>

Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
    -100 <= Node.val <= 100



## Thinking
Do dfs traversal to count the max length below the node and return. Also track the max length of the left child and right child. 

## Coding
Time: O(n);  number of node
Space: O(logn);

### Solution
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

class Solution {
    int maxLength = 0;
    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        dfs(root);
        return maxLength;
    }

    private int dfs(TreeNode root)
    {
        if (root == null) return 0;

        int longestLeft = dfs(root.left);
        int longestRight = dfs(root.right);

        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, longestLeft + longestRight);
        // add one because need to add one path from the current node to parent
        return Math.max(longestLeft, longestRight) + 1;
    }
}
```
