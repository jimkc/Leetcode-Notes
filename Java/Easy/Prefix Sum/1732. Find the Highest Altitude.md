## Question
There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.

You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude between points i and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest is 1.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1]. The highest is 0.
</pre>

Constraints:

    n == gain.length
    1 <= n <= 100
    -100 <= gain[i] <= 100

Time: O(n)

Space: O(1)

### Solution 1 Greedy
```java
class Solution {
    public int largestAltitude(int[] gain) {
        int max = Math.max(0, gain[0]);

        for (int i=1; i<gain.length; i++)
        {
            gain[i] = gain[i] + gain[i-1];
            if (gain[i] > max)
            {
                max = gain[i];
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
