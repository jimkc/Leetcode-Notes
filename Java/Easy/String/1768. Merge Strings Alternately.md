## Question
You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.
https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/description/


**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d
</pre>

Constraints:

    1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
    word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

### Solution 1 Reverse LL
```java
class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {

        final StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        int i=0;
        while (i<word1.length() || i< word2.length())
        {
            if(i<word1.length())
            {
                result.append(word1.charAt(i));
            }
            if(i<word2.length())
            {
                result.append(word2.charAt(i));
            }
            i++;
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
}
```
