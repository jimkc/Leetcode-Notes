## Question
Given two strings s and goal, return true if you can swap two letters in s so the result is equal to goal, otherwise, return false.

Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that i != j and swapping the characters at s[i] and s[j].

    For example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad".


**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: s = "ab", goal = "ba"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to goal.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: s = "ab", goal = "ab"
Output: false
Explanation: The only letters you can swap are s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b', which results in "ba" != goal.</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
Input: s = "aa", goal = "aa"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'a' to get "aa", which is equal to goal.
</pre>

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 2 * 104
    s and goal consist of lowercase letters.

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean buddyStrings(String s, String goal) {
        if (s.length() != goal.length())
        {
            return false;
        }


        int n = s.length();
        if (s.equals(goal))
        {
            Set<Character> temp = new HashSet<>();
            for (char c: s.toCharArray())
            {
                temp.add(c);
            }
            // if set size is smaller than goal, it means there exists at least 
            // one letter that has duplicates to swap
            return temp.size() < goal.length();
        }

        int i = 0;
        int j = n -1;

        // find two different chars, swap then check if it is the goal
        while (i < (n-1) && s.charAt(i) == goal.charAt(i))
        {
            i++;
        }

        while (j >= 0 && s.charAt(j) == goal.charAt(j))
        {
            j--;
        }

        if (i < j)
        {
            char[] sArr = s.toCharArray();
            char temp = sArr[i];
            sArr[i] = sArr[j];
            sArr[j] = temp;
            s = new String(sArr);
        }

        return s.equals(goal);
    }
}
