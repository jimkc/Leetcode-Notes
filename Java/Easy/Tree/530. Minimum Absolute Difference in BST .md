## Question
Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum absolute difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst/description/

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3]
Output: 1
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: root = [1,0,48,null,null,12,49]
Output: 1
</pre>


## Thinking
We define a prev variable to keep track of the previously visited node during the in-order traversal.

We initialize the minDiff variable to Integer.MAX_VALUE, which will store the minimum absolute difference between any two nodes.

We call the inOrderTraversal method to perform the in-order traversal of the BST.

In the inOrderTraversal method:

If the current node is null, we return and move to the next iteration.

We recursively traverse the left subtree.

If the prev node is not null, we calculate the absolute difference between the current node's value and the prev node's value and update minDiff if necessary.  

We update prev to the current node.

We recursively traverse the right subtree.

After completing the in-order traversal, we return the minDiff, which represents the minimum absolute difference between any two different nodes in the BST.

## Coding
Time complexity: O(N) , N is the number if nodes 
Space complexity: O(1)

### Solution
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    // During inorder traversal, this is the previous node, which will also be the nearest next smallest value compare to the current node
    private TreeNode prev;
    private int minDiff;

    public int getMinimumDifference(TreeNode root) {
        prev = null;
        minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        inorderTraversal(root);
        return minDiff;
    }

    private void inorderTraversal(TreeNode node)
    {
        if (node == null)
        {
            return;
        }

        inorderTraversal(node.left);

        if (prev != null)
        {
            minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, node.val - prev.val);
        }

        // move the prev to node because below are traversing right side which is the next larger value
        prev = node;

        inorderTraversal(node.right);
    }
}
```
