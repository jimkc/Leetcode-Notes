## Question
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
</pre>

Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 104
    -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1

## Thinking
To move all the zeros to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements in-place, you can use a two-pointer approach.   
One pointer (writePointer) will keep track of where the next non-zero element should be placed,   
and the other pointer (readPointer) will traverse the array to find non-zero elements and move them to the correct position.  
The mindset is to continue throwing non-zero elements read pointer meets to the front until it reaches the end.

The step "If readPointer is ahead of writePointer, set the current position to zero" is an optimization to avoid unnecessary assignments. Let me explain why this step is included:

In the two-pointer approach, we use readPointer to find non-zero elements and writePointer to place those non-zero elements at the correct position. The idea is to move non-zero elements towards the front of the array, keeping their relative order while pushing zeros to the end of the array.

Consider the scenario where readPointer is ahead of writePointer, which can happen when we've encountered multiple non-zero elements in a row. In this situation, readPointer is pointing to a non-zero element, and writePointer is pointing to an earlier position where we've already placed a non-zero element.

Since we're maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements, we don't need to make an assignment to the same position where readPointer is pointing. The element at that position is already a non-zero element, and we don't need to change it. So, we skip the assignment (nums[readPointer] = 0) when readPointer is ahead of writePointer to avoid unnecessary operations.

This optimization doesn't affect the correctness of the algorithm but can improve its efficiency by reducing unnecessary assignments when there are consecutive non-zero elements. It's a common technique used to make such algorithms more efficient.

## Coding
Time: O(n)

Space: O(1) in place.

### Solution 1
```java
class Solution {
    public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
        int writePointer = 0; // Pointer to place non-zero elements

        for (int readPointer = 0; readPointer < nums.length; readPointer++) {
            if (nums[readPointer] != 0) {
                // Move the non-zero element to the current writePointer position
                nums[writePointer] = nums[readPointer];

                // If readPointer is ahead of writePointer, set the current position to writer pointer value (should always be zero in this situation)
                // Since we're maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements, we don't need to make an assignment to the same position where readPointer is pointing. The element at that position is already a non-zero element, and we don't need to change it. So, we skip the assignment (nums[readPointer] = 0) when readPointer is ahead of writePointer to avoid unnecessary operations.
                if (readPointer != writePointer) {
                    nums[readPointer] = 0;
                }

                writePointer++; // Move the writePointer
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Solution 2
```java
class Solution {
    // Shift non-zero values as far forward as possible
// Fill remaining space with zeros

    public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return;

        int insertPos = 0;
        for (int num: nums) {
            if (num != 0) nums[insertPos++] = num;
        }

        while (insertPos < nums.length) {
            nums[insertPos++] = 0;
        }
    }
}
```
