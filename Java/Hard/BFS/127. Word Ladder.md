## Question
A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:

Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
sk == endWord
Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.

 

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
</pre>

Constraints:
* 1 <= beginWord.length <= 10
* endWord.length == beginWord.length
* 1 <= wordList.length <= 5000
* wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
* beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
* beginWord != endWord
* All the words in wordList are unique.

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

    private int height(TreeNode root, List<List<Integer>> ans){
        if (root == null) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        int leftLevel = height(root.left, ans);
        int rightLevel = height(root.right, ans);
        int level = 1 + Math.max(leftLevel, rightLevel);
        if (ans.size() < level+1) {
            ans.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        ans.get(level).add(root.val);
        return level;
