## Question
You are given an array routes representing bus routes where routes[i] is a bus route that the ith bus repeats forever.

    For example, if routes[0] = [1, 5, 7], this means that the 0th bus travels in the sequence 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> ... forever.

You will start at the bus stop source (You are not on any bus initially), and you want to go to the bus stop target. You can travel between bus stops by buses only.

Return the least number of buses you must take to travel from source to target. Return -1 if it is not possible.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: routes = [[1,2,7],[3,6,7]], source = 1, target = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: The best strategy is take the first bus to the bus stop 7, then take the second bus to the bus stop 6.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: routes = [[7,12],[4,5,15],[6],[15,19],[9,12,13]], source = 15, target = 12
Output: -1
</pre>

Constraints:

    1 <= routes.length <= 500.
    1 <= routes[i].length <= 105
    All the values of routes[i] are unique.
    sum(routes[i].length) <= 105
    0 <= routes[i][j] < 106
    0 <= source, target < 106

## Thinking
https://leetcode.com/problems/bus-routes/

Need to construct a map to match bus stops to routes. So when we visited the bus stop we can decide which route to take.

Also create an array to understand which route has already been taken so we don't get into a loop.

Record the buses taken as part of the things stored in the queue.

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int numBusesToDestination(int[][] routes, int source, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Set<Integer>> stopToRoutes = new HashMap<>();

        for (int i=0; i<routes.length; i++)
        {
            for (int j: routes[i])
            {
                if (!stopToRoutes.containsKey(j))
                {
                    stopToRoutes.put(j, new HashSet<>());
                }
                stopToRoutes.get(j).add(i);
            }
        }

        // int[] contains two numbers, 1st is the bus stop the second one is how many buses have taken
        Queue<int[]> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        queue.offer(new int[]{source, 0});

        // bus stop that we have visited
        Set<Integer> visited = new HashSet<>();
        visited.add(source);

        // used to avoid visiting the route (loop) again 
        boolean[] visitedRoutes = new boolean[routes.length];

        while(!queue.isEmpty())
        {
            int[] p = queue.poll();
            int stop = p[0];
            int busTaken = p[1];

            if (stop == target) return busTaken;
            // now we need to decide which route to take later from the current stop

            if (!stopToRoutes.containsKey(stop)) continue;
            for (int route: stopToRoutes.get(stop))
            {
                if (visitedRoutes[route]) continue;
                visitedRoutes[route] = true;
                for (int nextStop: routes[route])
                {
                    if (!visited.contains(nextStop))
                    {
                        visited.add(nextStop);
                        queue.offer(new int[]{nextStop, busTaken+1});
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
