## Question
Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:

1. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
2. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
3. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.
The '.' character indicates empty cells.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: board = [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: [["5","3","4","6","7","8","9","1","2"],["6","7","2","1","9","5","3","4","8"],["1","9","8","3","4","2","5","6","7"],["8","5","9","7","6","1","4","2","3"],["4","2","6","8","5","3","7","9","1"],["7","1","3","9","2","4","8","5","6"],["9","6","1","5","3","7","2","8","4"],["2","8","7","4","1","9","6","3","5"],["3","4","5","2","8","6","1","7","9"]]
Explanation: The input board is shown above and the only valid solution is shown below:
</pre>

Constraints:
* board.length == 9
* board[i].length == 9
* board[i][j] is a digit or '.'.
* It is guaranteed that the input board has only one solution.

### Solution 
Time: O(1)  
Space: O(1)  
```java
class Solution {
    public void solveSudoku(char[][] board) {
        if (board == null || board.length == 0) return;
        solve(board);
    }

    private boolean solve(char[][] board) {
        for (int i=0; i<9; i++) {
            for (int j=0; j<9; j++){
                if (board[i][j] != '.') continue;

                for (char num='1'; num<='9'; num++){
                    if (isValid(board, i, j, num)){
                        board[i][j] = num;
                        if (solve(board)) return true;
                        board[i][j] = '.';
                    }
                }
                // all nums failed to fit
                return false;
            }
        }
        // edge case when boundary hits and go to the next level of dfs,should return true
        return true;
    }

    private boolean isValid(char[][] board, int row, int col, char c) {
        // define which 3*3 box it is in
        int regionStartRow = 3 * (row/3); 
        int regionStartCol = 3 * (col/3);
        for (int i=0; i<9; i++) {
            if (board[i][col] == c) return false;
            if (board[row][i] == c) return false;
            // this will go through the 3*3 box
            if (board[regionStartRow + i/3][regionStartCol + i%3] == c) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
