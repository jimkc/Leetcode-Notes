## Question
You are given two 0-indexed arrays nums and cost consisting each of n positive integers.  
  
You can do the following operation any number of times:  
  
Increase or decrease any element of the array nums by 1.  
The cost of doing one operation on the ith element is cost[i].  
  
Return the minimum total cost such that all the elements of the array nums become equal.  
  
**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [1,3,5,2], cost = [2,3,1,14]
Output: 8
Explanation: We can make all the elements equal to 2 in the following way:
- Increase the 0th element one time. The cost is 2.
- Decrease the 1st element one time. The cost is 3.
- Decrease the 2nd element three times. The cost is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
The total cost is 2 + 3 + 3 = 8.
It can be shown that we cannot make the array equal with a smaller cost.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2], cost = [4,2,8,1,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: All the elements are already equal, so no operations are needed.
</pre>

Constraints:
* n == nums.length == cost.length
* 1 <= n <= 105
* 1 <= nums[i], cost[i] <= 106
* Test cases are generated in a way that the output doesn't exceed 253-1

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public long minCost(int[] nums, int[] cost) {
        long left = nums[0];
        long right = nums[0];
        for (int n: nums){
            left = Math.min(left, n);
            right = Math.max(right, n);
        }

        // trinary search
        long ans = 0;
        while (left < right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left)/2;
            long cost1 = findCost(nums, cost, mid);
            long cost2 = findCost(nums, cost, mid+1);

            if (cost1 > cost2) {
                left = mid+1;
                ans = cost2;
            } else {
                right = mid;
                ans = cost1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }

    private long findCost(int[] nums, int[] cost, long x){
        long res = 0;

        for (int i=0; i<nums.length; i++) {
            res += Math.abs(nums[i]-x)*cost[i];
        }
        return res;
    }
}
