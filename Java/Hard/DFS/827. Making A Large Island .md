## Question
You are given an n x n binary matrix grid. You are allowed to change at most one 0 to be 1.

Return the size of the largest island in grid after applying this operation.

An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1s.

https://leetcode.com/problems/making-a-large-island/description/

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Change one 0 to 1 and connect two 1s, then we get an island with area = 3.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: grid = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Change the 0 to 1 and make the island bigger, only one island with area = 4.
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
Input: grid = [[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Can't change any 0 to 1, only one island with area = 4.
</pre>

Constraints:

    n == grid.length
    n == grid[i].length
    1 <= n <= 500
    grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.



## Thinking
Use DFS or BFS to change each island with a number that represents it, this helps the later process to differentiate the grid belongs to which island.  
After that we can go through all grid that is 0 and add up the up down left right island and get the one that is the largest. 


## Coding
Time: O(n) go through the grids

Space: O(n) the grids size

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int dfs(int i, int j, int[][] grid, int rows, int cols, int color) {
        // Recursive depth-first search (DFS) function to explore the island.
        if (i < 0 || i >= rows || j < 0 || j >= cols)
            return 0; // If we're out of bounds, return 0.
        if (grid[i][j] == 0 || grid[i][j] == color)
            return 0; // If the current cell is water or has already been visited with the same color, return 0.

        grid[i][j] = color; // Mark the cell with the current color.
        int count = 1; // Initialize the island size count to 1 (for the current cell).

        // Recursively explore neighboring cells in all four directions.
        count += dfs(i + 1, j, grid, rows, cols, color);
        count += dfs(i - 1, j, grid, rows, cols, color);
        count += dfs(i, j - 1, grid, rows, cols, color);
        count += dfs(i, j + 1, grid, rows, cols, color);

        return count; // Return the total island size.
    }

    public int largestIsland(int[][] grid) {
        int rows = grid.length;
        int cols = grid[0].length;

        HashMap<Integer, Integer> mp = new HashMap<>(); // A HashMap to store island colors and their respective sizes.
        int color = 2; // Start with the color '2' for the first island.

        // Iterate through the grid to identify and label islands with unique colors.
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    int count = dfs(i, j, grid, rows, cols, color); // Perform DFS to find the size of the island.
                    mp.put(color, count); // Store the island's color and size in the HashMap.
                    color++; // Move to the next color for the next island.
                }
            }
        }

        int result = 0; // Initialize the result as 0.

        // Iterate through the grid again to find the largest possible island.
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
                    HashSet<Integer> st = new HashSet<>(); // HashSet to store unique neighboring island colors.

                    // Check the colors of neighboring cells and add them to the HashSet.
                    if (i - 1 >= 0 && grid[i - 1][j] != 0)
                        st.add(grid[i - 1][j]);
                    if (i + 1 < rows && grid[i + 1][j] != 0)
                        st.add(grid[i + 1][j]);
                    if (j - 1 >= 0 && grid[i][j - 1] != 0)
                        st.add(grid[i][j - 1]);
                    if (j + 1 < cols && grid[i][j + 1] != 0)
                        st.add(grid[i][j + 1]);

                    int sum = 1; // Initialize the size of the current possible island (1 for the current cell).

                    // Calculate the total size of the possible island by adding sizes of neighboring islands.
                    for (int it : st)
                        sum += mp.get(it);

                    result = Math.max(result, sum); // Update the result with the maximum island size found.

                }
            }
        }

        // If no land is present in the grid, return the total grid size as the result.
        return result == 0 ? (rows * cols) : result;
    }
}
