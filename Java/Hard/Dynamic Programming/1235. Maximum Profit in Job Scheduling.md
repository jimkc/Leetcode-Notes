## Question
We have n jobs, where every job is scheduled to be done from startTime[i] to endTime[i], obtaining a profit of profit[i].  
  
You're given the startTime, endTime and profit arrays, return the maximum profit you can take such that there are no two jobs in the subset with overlapping time range.  
  
If you choose a job that ends at time X you will be able to start another job that starts at time X.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: startTime = [1,2,3,3], endTime = [3,4,5,6], profit = [50,10,40,70]
Output: 120
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first and fourth job. 
Time range [1-3]+[3-6] , we get profit of 120 = 50 + 70.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: startTime = [1,2,3,4,6], endTime = [3,5,10,6,9], profit = [20,20,100,70,60]
Output: 150
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first, fourth and fifth job. 
Profit obtained 150 = 20 + 70 + 60.
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
Input: startTime = [1,1,1], endTime = [2,3,4], profit = [5,6,4]
Output: 6
</pre>

Constraints:
* 1 <= startTime.length == endTime.length == profit.length <= 5 * 104
* 1 <= startTime[i] < endTime[i] <= 109
* 1 <= profit[i] <= 104

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int jobScheduling(int[] startTime, int[] endTime, int[] profit) {
        int n = startTime.length;
        int[][] tmp = new int[n][3];

        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            tmp[i][0] = startTime[i];
            tmp[i][1] = endTime[i];
            tmp[i][2] = profit[i];
        }
        // sort by end time
        Arrays.sort(tmp, (a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]);

        // key is end time, value is max profit possibly earn
        TreeMap<Integer, Integer> dp = new TreeMap<>();
        dp.put(0, 0);

        for (int[] job: tmp) {
            int start = job[0];
            int end = job[1];
            int currProfit = job[2];

            // get end time <= start time
            int closestEndTime = dp.floorKey(start);
            int prevJobMaxProfit = dp.get(closestEndTime);

            int maxProfitWithCurr = prevJobMaxProfit + currProfit;
            // compare with the last element which has end time <= curr end time
            int maxProfitInDp = dp.lastEntry().getValue();
            if (maxProfitWithCurr > maxProfitInDp) {
                // worth doing the job
                dp.put(end, maxProfitWithCurr);
            }
        }
        return dp.lastEntry().getValue();
    }
}
