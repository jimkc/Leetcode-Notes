## Question
You are given a list of airline tickets where tickets[i] = [fromi, toi] represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it.  
  
All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from "JFK", thus, the itinerary must begin with "JFK". If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.  
  
* For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].  
You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: tickets = [["MUC","LHR"],["JFK","MUC"],["SFO","SJC"],["LHR","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","MUC","LHR","SFO","SJC"]
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"] but it is larger in lexical order.
</pre>

Constraints:  
* 1 <= tickets.length <= 300
* tickets[i].length == 2
* fromi.length == 3
* toi.length == 3
* fromi and toi consist of uppercase English letters.
* fromi != toi




## Thinking
https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/solutions/78768/short-ruby-python-java-c

1. Create a minheap to maintain each arrival airport is in lexical order.
2. Use LinkedList because during dfs traversal we poll out the arrival airports in lexical order so we want to insert in index 0, and linked list addfirst is O(1), better than array list.

## Coding
Time: O(nlogn) for dfs complexity. or O(V+E) 

Space: O(n) for list and map.

### Solution 
```java
class Solution {
    Map<String, PriorityQueue<String>> map = new HashMap<>();
    List<String> route = new LinkedList<>();

    public List<String> findItinerary(List<List<String>> tickets) {
        for (List<String> t: tickets)
        {
            String depart = t.get(0);
            String arrive = t.get(1);
            if (!map.containsKey(depart))
            {
                map.put(depart, new PriorityQueue<>());
            }
            map.get(depart).offer(arrive);
        }
        visit("JFK");
        return route;
    }

    // dfs with reverse lexical order, but insert with lexical order
    private void visit(String airport)
    {
        while (map.containsKey(airport) && !map.get(airport).isEmpty())
        {
            visit(map.get(airport).poll());
        }
        // use linked list to have o(1), and use insert 0 instead of append
        // because we will add depart only after all arrival is added.
        route.addFirst(airport);
    }
}
```
