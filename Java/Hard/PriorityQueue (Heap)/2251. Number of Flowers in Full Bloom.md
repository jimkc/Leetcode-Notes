## Question
You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array flowers, where flowers[i] = [starti, endi] means the ith flower will be in full bloom from starti to endi (inclusive). You are also given a 0-indexed integer array people of size n, where people[i] is the time that the ith person will arrive to see the flowers.

Return an integer array answer of size n, where answer[i] is the number of flowers that are in full bloom when the ith person arrives.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: flowers = [[1,6],[3,7],[9,12],[4,13]], people = [2,3,7,11]
Output: [1,2,2,2]
Explanation: The figure above shows the times when the flowers are in full bloom and when the people arrive.
For each person, we return the number of flowers in full bloom during their arrival.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: flowers = [[1,10],[3,3]], people = [3,3,2]
Output: [2,2,1]
Explanation: The figure above shows the times when the flowers are in full bloom and when the people arrive.
For each person, we return the number of flowers in full bloom during their arrival.
</pre>

Constraints:
* 1 <= flowers.length <= 5 * 104
* flowers[i].length == 2
* 1 <= starti <= endi <= 109
* 1 <= people.length <= 5 * 104
* 1 <= people[i] <= 109

## Coding
Given n as the length of flowers and m as the length of people:  
Time: O(nlogn + m(logn + logm)  
Space: O(n)

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] fullBloomFlowers(int[][] flowers, int[] people) {
        int n = people.length;
        int[][] sortedPeople = new int[n][2];
        int[] ans = new int[n];

        for (int i=0; i<n; i++)
        {
            sortedPeople[i][0] = people[i];
            sortedPeople[i][1] = i;
        }
        // sort the arrival time from earliest to latest
        Arrays.sort(sortedPeople, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        // sort the flowers start time from earliest to latest
        Arrays.sort(flowers, (a,b) -> a[0] - b[0]);

        // go through all the flowers
        int i=0;
        Queue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        
        for (int[] p: sortedPeople)
        {
            int arriveTime = p[0];
            int index = p[1];

            // add all the flowers with start time ealier than the people to the heap
            // only add end time to evaluate if people can see it later
            while (i<flowers.length && flowers[i][0] <= arriveTime)
            {
                minHeap.add(flowers[i][1]);
                i++;
            }
            
            // check if end time is after people
            while(!minHeap.isEmpty() && minHeap.peek() < arriveTime)
            {
                minHeap.poll();
                
            }
            // the remaining flowers in the minHeap is the flower people can see and also candidate the remaining people can see
            ans[index] = minHeap.size();
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
