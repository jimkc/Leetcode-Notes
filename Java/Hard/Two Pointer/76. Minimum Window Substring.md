## Question
Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".  
  
The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.  
  
**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
</pre>

Constraints:  
* m == s.length
* n == t.length
* 1 <= m, n <= 105
* s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

Follow up: Could you find an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?

## Thinking
Use start and end two pointers to slide through s. Once start and end contains all the letters in t move start one by one until we met a character that is not in t, then we can continue moving end pointer again.


## Coding
Time: O(n+m).  
Space: O(1)
### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public String minWindow(String s, String t) {
        if (s == null || s == "" || t == null || t == "" || s.length() < t.length()){
            return "";
        }

        int[] map = new int[128];
        int countRemainChar = t.length();
        int start = 0, end = 0, minLen = Integer.MAX_VALUE, startIndex = 0;
         for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
            map[c]++;
        }

        while (end < s.length())
        {
            if (map[s.charAt(end++)]-- > 0) {
                countRemainChar--;
            }
            
            while (countRemainChar == 0) {
                // end ++ on top 
                int length = end - start;
                if (length < minLen) {
                    minLen = length;
                    startIndex = start;
                }
                // move start index to the right
                // during the above window scanning we decreased all chars we 
                // met in s, and only chars in t has > 0 initialiiy in map
                // if we met chars not is t it will be < 0 in map now
                if (map[s.charAt(start++)]++ == 0) {
                    // char is in t
                    countRemainChar++;
                }
            }
        }
        return minLen == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? "" : s.substring(startIndex, startIndex+minLen);
    }
}
