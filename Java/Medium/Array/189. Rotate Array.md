## Question
Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.  

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
</pre>

Constraints:  
* 1 <= nums.length <= 105  
* -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1  
* 0 <= k <= 105  

## Thinking
Again, we use remainder.

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 9
To explain the algorithm first, it performs three reverse operations.
```

First of all, we reverse all numbers.

```
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
↓
[7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
```

Then, we create two groups like solution 2. Before k and After k.

```
     k
[7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
 # # * * * * *

k is remainder
```
Then, reverse all numbers in each group.

```
     k
[7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
 # # * * * * *
↓
     k
[6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
 # # * * * * *
 ```
`[6,7,1,2,3,4,5]`` is actually answer.

To summarize the algorithm, we use 3 reverse operation.
```
reverse(0, last index) → whole array
reverse(0, k - 1) → before k
reverse(k, last index) → after k
```

## Coding
Time: O(n)

Space: O(1)

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        k %= nums.length;

        reverse(nums, 0, nums.length-1);
        reverse(nums, 0, k-1);
        reverse(nums, k, nums.length-1);
    }

    private void reverse(int[] nums, int left, int right)
    {
        while( left < right)
        {
            int temp = nums[left];
            nums[left] = nums[right];
            nums[right] = temp;
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }
}
```
