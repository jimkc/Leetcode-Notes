## Question
If the depth of a tree is smaller than 5, then this tree can be represented by an array of three-digit integers. For each integer in this array:

    The hundreds digit represents the depth d of this node where 1 <= d <= 4.
    The tens digit represents the position p of this node in the level it belongs to where 1 <= p <= 8. The position is the same as that in a full binary tree.
    The units digit represents the value v of this node where 0 <= v <= 9.

Given an array of ascending three-digit integers nums representing a binary tree with a depth smaller than 5, return the sum of all paths from the root towards the leaves.

It is guaranteed that the given array represents a valid connected binary tree.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [113,215,221]
Output: 12
Explanation: The tree that the list represents is shown.
The path sum is (3 + 5) + (3 + 1) = 12.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [113,221]
Output: 4
Explanation: The tree that the list represents is shown. 
The path sum is (3 + 1) = 4.
</pre>

Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 15
    110 <= nums[i] <= 489
    nums represents a valid binary tree with depth less than 5.

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int pathSum(int[] nums) {
        // int[level][position]
        int[][] path = new int[5][9];
        // set all default to -1
        for (int[] p: path) Arrays.fill(p, -1);
        for (int n: nums)
        {
            path[n/100][n%100/10] = n%10;
        }
        return addSum(path, 1, 1, 0);
    }

    private int addSum(int[][] path, int level, int position, int sum)
    {
        if (level >= 5 || position >= 9 || path[level][position] == -1)
        {
            return 0;
        }

        sum += path[level][position];
        int l = addSum(path, level+1, position*2 - 1, sum);
        int r = addSum(path, level+1, position*2, sum);
        // if r + l == 0 means both r and l is 0, which also means this node has no child
        // so return the value added so far to its parent
        return r + l == 0? sum: r+l;
    }
}
```
