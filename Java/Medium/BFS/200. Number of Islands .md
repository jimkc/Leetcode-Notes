## Question
Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
</pre>


Constraints:

    m == grid.length
    n == grid[i].length
    1 <= m, n <= 300
    grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.


## Thinking

## Coding
Time: O(mn);  
Space: O(1);

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        int m = grid[0].length;

        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        int[][] direction = new int[][]{{1,0}, {0,1}, {-1,0}, {0,-1}};

        int ans = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++)
        {
            for (int j=0; j<m; j++)
            {
                if (grid[i][j] == '0')
                {
                    continue;
                }
                else
                {
                    ans += 1;
                    queue.offer(new int[]{i,j});
                    grid[i][j] = '0';

                    // bfs 
                    while (!queue.isEmpty())
                    {
                        int[] land = queue.poll();

                        for (int[] dir: direction)
                        {
                            int x = land[0] + dir[0];
                            int y = land[1] + dir[1];

                            if (!(x < 0 || x > n-1 || y < 0 || y > m-1) && grid[x][y] == '1')
                            {
                                queue.offer(new int[]{x, y});
                                grid[x][y] = '0';
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
