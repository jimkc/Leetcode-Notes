## Question
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
</pre>


Constraints:
* 1 <= numCourses <= 2000
* 0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000
* prerequisites[i].length == 2
* 0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
* All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.


## Thinking
Use an array to track how many courses that the current courses needs to do before taking.  
Add the course to the queue only after all the courses pre are done.

## Coding
Time: O(n);  number of prerequisites
Space: O(n);

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        int[] countCoursesToDo = new int[numCourses];
        int[] ans = new int[numCourses];

        List<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[numCourses];
        for (int i=0; i<numCourses; i++){
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }

        for (int[] p: prerequisites){
            int pre = p[1];
            int thenTake = p[0];
            countCoursesToDo[thenTake]+=1;
            graph[pre].add(thenTake);
        }
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        int ansIdx = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<numCourses; i++) {
            if (countCoursesToDo[i] == 0){
                q.offer(i);
                ans[ansIdx++] = i;
            }
        }

        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int classTake = q.poll();

            for (int thenTake: graph[classTake]){
                countCoursesToDo[thenTake]--;
                if (countCoursesToDo[thenTake] == 0){
                    q.offer(thenTake);
                    ans[ansIdx++] = thenTake;
                }
            }
        }
        return ansIdx == numCourses;
    }
}
```
