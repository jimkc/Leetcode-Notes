## Question
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

    For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.

Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
Output: [0]
</pre>

Constraints:

    1 <= numCourses <= 2000
    0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1)
    prerequisites[i].length == 2
    0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
    ai != bi
    All the pairs [ai, bi] are distinct.


## Thinking
Use an array to track how many courses that the current courses needs to do before taking.  
Add the course to the queue only after all the courses pre are done.

## Coding
Time: O(n);  number of prerequisites
Space: O(n);

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findOrder(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        // number of courses to do before taking course i
        int[] countCourseToDo = new int[numCourses] ;
        int[] ans = new int[numCourses];
        // directed graph
        List<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[numCourses];
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < prerequisites.length; i++) {
            int pre = prerequisites[i][1];
            int thenTake = prerequisites[i][0];
            // found one course pre to do before thenTake
            countCourseToDo[thenTake]++;
            graph[pre].add(thenTake);
        }
        int index = 0;
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            // means i does not have prerequisite courses, we can start traversing from there
            if (countCourseToDo[i] == 0) {
                q.offer(i);
                ans[index++] = i;
            }
        }
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            // finished course
            int courseDone = q.poll();
            // finished courseDone so all degree that has courseDone as pre should -1
            for (int course : graph[courseDone]) {
                countCourseToDo[course]--;
                // all pre courses are finished we can add to queue and take it later
                if (countCourseToDo[course] == 0) {
                    q.offer(course);
                    ans[index++] = course;
                }
            }
        }
        return index == numCourses ? ans : new int[0];
    }
}
