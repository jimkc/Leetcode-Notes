## Question
You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.  
  
The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.  
  
Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.  
  
**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
</pre>

Constraints:  
* m == grid.length
* n == grid[i].length
* 1 <= m, n <= 50
* grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxAreaOfIsland(int[][] grid) {
        if (grid.length == 0 || grid[0].length == 0){
            return 0;
        }

        int n = grid.length;
        int m = grid[0].length;
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            for (int j=0; j<m; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    // traverse and get island size
                    int size = bfs(grid, i, j);
                    ans = Math.max(ans, size);
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }

    private int bfs(int[][] grid, int i, int j) {
        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(new int[]{i, j});
        grid[i][j] = 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        int[][] dir = new int[][]{{1,0}, {-1,0}, {0,1}, {0,-1}};
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] land = queue.poll();
            count++;

            for (int[] d : dir) {
                int x = land[0] + d[0];
                int y = land[1] + d[1];

                if (x >= 0 && x<grid.length && y>=0 && y<grid[0].length && grid[x][y] == 1) {
                    queue.offer(new int[]{x,y});
                    grid[x][y] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
