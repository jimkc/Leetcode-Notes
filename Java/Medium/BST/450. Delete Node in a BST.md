## Question
You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers w where w[i] describes the weight of the ith index.

You need to implement the function pickIndex(), which randomly picks an index in the range [0, w.length - 1] (inclusive) and returns it. The probability of picking an index i is w[i] / sum(w).

    For example, if w = [1, 3], the probability of picking index 0 is 1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25 (i.e., 25%), and the probability of picking index 1 is 3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75 (i.e., 75%).

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output
[null,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. The only option is to return 0 since there is only one element in w.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output
[null,1,1,1,1,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 3]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1. It is returning the second element (index = 1) that has a probability of 3/4.
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. It is returning the first element (index = 0) that has a probability of 1/4.

Since this is a randomization problem, multiple answers are allowed.
All of the following outputs can be considered correct:
[null,1,1,1,1,0]
[null,1,1,1,1,1]
[null,1,1,1,0,0]
[null,1,1,1,0,1]
[null,1,0,1,0,0]
......
and so on.
</pre>

Constraints:

    1 <= w.length <= 104
    1 <= w[i] <= 105
    pickIndex will be called at most 104 times.



## Thinking
https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/solutions/154024/JAVA-8-lines-TreeMap/

Tree map is a type of self-balancing binary search tree. 

Random can create the random within the range of 0 - n-1



## Coding
Time: O(logn) for the search, O(nlogn) for tree map construction

Space: O(n)

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    int cnt = 0;
    TreeMap<Integer, Integer> map = new TreeMap<>();
    Random rnd= new Random();

    public Solution(int[] w) {
        // w size is guranteed to >=1
        for (int i=0; i<w.length; i++)
        {
            cnt += w[i];
            map.put(cnt, i);
        }
    }

    public int pickIndex() {
        // higher key returns the key that is the next higher than rnd 
        int key = map.higherKey(rnd.nextInt(cnt));
        return map.get(key);
    }
}

/**
 * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * Solution obj = new Solution(w);
 * int param_1 = obj.pickIndex();
 */
```
