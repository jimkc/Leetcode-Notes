## Question
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
</pre>

Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 1000
    -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
    nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.

## Thinking
When we do binary search we always search for the side with upper slopes we will finally reach a peak, because
we know that the boundaries are infinitely small so there must exist a peak in that direction.

## Coding
Time: O(logn)

Space: O(1)

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;

        if (n == 1) return 0;
        if (nums[0] > nums[1]) return 0;
        if (nums[n-1] > nums[n-2]) return n-1;

        int left = 1;
        int right = n-2;

        while (left <= right)
        {
            int mid = left + (right - left)/2;
            // there will be a peak exist in the upper slope as we know the boundary is infinite
            // small
            if (nums[mid] > nums[mid-1] && nums[mid] > nums[mid+1]) return mid;
            else if (nums[mid] < nums[mid-1]) right = mid - 1;
            else if (nums[mid] < nums[mid+1]) left = mid + 1;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
