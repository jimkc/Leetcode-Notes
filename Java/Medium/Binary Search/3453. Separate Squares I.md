## Question
You are given a 2D integer array squares. Each squares[i] = [xi, yi, li] represents the coordinates of the bottom-left point and the side length of a square parallel to the x-axis.  
  
Find the minimum y-coordinate value of a horizontal line such that the total area of the squares above the line equals the total area of the squares below the line.  
  
Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.  
  
Note: Squares may overlap. Overlapping areas should be counted multiple times.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: squares = [[0,0,1],[2,2,1]]

Output: 1.00000

Explanation:
Any horizontal line between y = 1 and y = 2 will have 1 square unit above it and 1 square unit below it. The lowest option is 1.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: squares = [[0,0,2],[1,1,1]]

Output: 1.16667

Explanation:
The areas are:

Below the line: 7/6 * 2 (Red) + 1/6 (Blue) = 15/6 = 2.5.
Above the line: 5/6 * 2 (Red) + 5/6 (Blue) = 15/6 = 2.5.
Since the areas above and below the line are equal, the output is 7/6 = 1.16667.
</pre>

Constraints:  
* 1 <= squares.length <= 5 * 104  
* squares[i] = [xi, yi, li]  
* squares[i].length == 3  
* 0 <= xi, yi <= 109  
* 1 <= li <= 109  
* The total area of all the squares will not exceed 1012

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public double separateSquares(int[][] squares) {
        double low = 0;
        double high = 2*1e9; // in constrait y < 1e9, l < 1e9
        double eps = 1e-5;// Tolerance level

        while (high - low > eps) 
        {
            double mid = (low + high)/2.0;
            double diff = helper(mid, squares);

            if (diff > 0)
            {
                low = mid;
            }
            else 
            {
                high = mid;
            }
        }
        return (high + low)/2.0;
    }

    public double helper(double line, int[][] squares)
    {
        double areaAbove = 0;
        double areaBelow = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<squares.length; i++)
        {
            int x = squares[i][0];
            int y = squares[i][1];
            int l = squares[i][2];
            double total = (double) l*l;

            if (line <= y)
            {
                areaAbove += total;
            }
            else if (line >= y + l)
            {
                areaBelow += total;
            }
            else
            {
                // line crossed the current square
                areaAbove += l * (y + l - line);
                areaBelow += l* (line - y);
            }
        }

        return areaAbove - areaBelow;
    }
}
