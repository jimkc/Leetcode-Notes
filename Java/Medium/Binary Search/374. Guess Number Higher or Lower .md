## Question
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

    -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
    1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
    0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).

Return the number that I picked.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
</pre>

Constraints:

    1 <= n <= 231 - 1
    1 <= pick <= n




## Thinking
Use `int mid = end +  (start - end)/2;` to prevent overflow;

## Coding
Time: O(n) 

Space: O(1)

### Solution
```java
/**
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param  num   your guess
 * @return 	     -1 if num is higher than the picked number
 *			      1 if num is lower than the picked number
 *               otherwise return 0
 * int guess(int num);
 */

public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        int end = n;
        int start = 1;

        while (start <= end)
        {
            int mid = end +  (start - end)/2;
            int g = guess(mid);
            if (g == 0)
            {
                return mid;
            }
            else if (g == 1)
            {
                start = mid +1;
            }
            else
            {
                end = mid -1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
