## Question
Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
Output: 30
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
Output: 23
</pre>

Constraints:

    1 <= piles.length <= 104
    piles.length <= h <= 109
    1 <= piles[i] <= 109


## Thinking

For the reason on why this test case will fail `[805306368, 805306368, 805306368]`
```
Because when mid equals 1, the hours would be 2415919104 which overflows the int type. The maximum of int type is 2147483647. 
The overflowed value would be -1879048192 in int type less than 1000000000 causing the failure. 
The problem can be solved only change the type of hours into type long which prevent overflow. Hope it helps.
```
Because it will add up in the helper function to the max of integer value, need to use long instead.

## Coding


    Time Complexity :- BigO(N * log(M)) where N is no of piles & M is range of K (left to right)

    Space Complexity :- BigO(1) as not using any extra space


### Solution
The trick here is do binary on the k which is the speed, imagine there is a list of ascending value from 1 to the max pile in piles.
```java
class Solution {
    public int minEatingSpeed(int[] piles, int h) {
        long left = 1;
        long right = 0;

        for (int p : piles)
        {
            if (p > right) right = (long) p;
        }

        while (left <= right)
        {
            long mid = left + (right - left)/2;
            if (canEatInTime(piles, mid, h)) right = mid - 1;
            else left = mid + 1;
        }
        return (int) left;
    }

    private boolean canEatInTime(int[] piles, long k, long h)
    {
        long hours = 0;
        for (int p: piles)
        {
            long div = (long) p/k;
            hours += div;
            if (p % k != 0) hours++;
        }
        return h >= hours;
    }
}
```
