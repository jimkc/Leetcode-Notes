## Question
Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., xn).

https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/description/

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10
Output: 1024.00000
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3
Output: 9.26100
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: x = 2.00000, n = -2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: 2-2 = 1/22 = 1/4 = 0.25
</pre>

Constraints:

    -100.0 < x < 100.0
    -231 <= n <= 231-1
    n is an integer.
    Either x is not zero or n > 0.
    -104 <= xn <= 104

## Coding
Time: O(logn)

Space: O(1)

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public double myPow(double x, int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 1;
        if (x == 1) return 1;

        if (n < 0)
        {
            n = -1*n;
            x = 1/x;
        }

        double ans = 1;
        // can't use n > 0 as -2147483648 is the smallest int and the largest int is -2147483647
        // so when we times it with -1 it overflows
        while (n != 0)
        {
            // the last bit representation of n is 0 means the ans does not need that digit during multiplication
            if ((n & 1) != 0)
            {
                ans *= x;
            }
            // x becomes power of 2 and n shifts bit 1 to the right
            x *= x;
            n >>>= 1;
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```
