## Question
Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
Root Node (3) is always a good node.
Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Root is considered as good.
</pre>

Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range [1, 10^5].
    Each node's value is between [-10^4, 10^4].


## Thinking

## Coding
Time: O(n)

Space: O(logn) the height of the tree

### Solution 1
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int goodNodes(TreeNode root)
    {
        return countGoodNodes(root, Integer.MIN_VALUE);
    }

    private int countGoodNodes(TreeNode root, int previousMax)
    {
        if (root == null) return 0;

        int goodNodes = 0;
        if (root.val >= previousMax)
        {
            goodNodes++;
        }

        goodNodes += countGoodNodes(root.left, Math.max(root.val, previousMax));
        goodNodes += countGoodNodes(root.right, Math.max(root.val, previousMax));

        return goodNodes;
    }
}
}
```
