## Question
Given the root of a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this:  
  
Collect all the leaf nodes.  
Remove all the leaf nodes.  
Repeat until the tree is empty.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [[4,5,3],[2],[1]]
Explanation:
[[3,5,4],[2],[1]] and [[3,4,5],[2],[1]] are also considered correct answers since per each level it does not matter the order on which elements are returned.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
</pre>

Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
* -100 <= Node.val <= 100

## Thinking
The idea is to pass the current found integer sum into the next level of recursion, and return it back again. So that we don't have to count the number of levels in the nested list.  
  
I think code itself is quite self explanatory.  

## Coding
Time: O(n). Each node is visited onceã€‚  
Space: O(d + n), where d is max depth and n is the node size for ans list.
### Solution
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> findLeaves(TreeNode root) {
        List<List<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        height(root, ans);
        return ans;
    }

    private int height(TreeNode root, List<List<Integer>> ans){
        if (root == null) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        int leftLevel = height(root.left, ans);
        int rightLevel = height(root.right, ans);
        int level = 1 + Math.max(leftLevel, rightLevel);
        if (ans.size() < level+1) {
            ans.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        ans.get(level).add(root.val);
        return level;
    }
}
```
