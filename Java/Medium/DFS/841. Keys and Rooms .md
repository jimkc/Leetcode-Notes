## Question
There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and all the rooms are locked except for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.

When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.

Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room i, return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false otherwise.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]
Output: true
Explanation: 
We visit room 0 and pick up key 1.
We then visit room 1 and pick up key 2.
We then visit room 2 and pick up key 3.
We then visit room 3.
Since we were able to visit every room, we return true.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
Output: false
Explanation: We can not enter room number 2 since the only key that unlocks it is in that room.
</pre>

Constraints:

    n == rooms.length
    2 <= n <= 1000
    0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000
    1 <= sum(rooms[i].length) <= 3000
    0 <= rooms[i][j] < n
    All the values of rooms[i] are unique.

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canVisitAllRooms(List<List<Integer>> rooms) {
        if (rooms.isEmpty()) return false;

        final boolean[] trace = new boolean[rooms.size()];
        dfs(rooms, trace, 0);

        for (boolean visit : trace)
        {
            if (!visit)
            {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    private void dfs(List<List<Integer>> rooms, boolean[] trace, int index)
    {
        trace[index] = true;
        if (rooms.get(index).isEmpty())
        {
            return;
        }

        for (int r : rooms.get(index))
        {
            if (trace[r])
            {
                continue;
            }
            else
            {
                dfs(rooms, trace, r);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
