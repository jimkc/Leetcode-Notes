## Question
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

    For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".

A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
</pre>

Constraints:

    1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
    text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2)
    {
        int n = text1.length();
        int m = text2.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[n+1][m+1];

        // initialize as zero as we set the first row and column as no chars
        for (int i=0; i<n+1; i++)
        {
            for (int j=0; j<m+1; j++)
            {
                dp[i][j] = 0;
            }
        }

        for (int i=1; i<n+1; i++)
        {
            for (int j=1; j<m+1; j++)
            {
                // the i index in the dp array is the i-1 char of the text
                if (text1.charAt(i-1) == text2.charAt(j-1))
                {
                    // only need diagonal as its left and right will always be the same
                    dp[i][j] =  dp[i-1][j-1] + 1;
                }
                else
                {
                    // get the max from the top or left in the diagram
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n][m];
    }
}
```
