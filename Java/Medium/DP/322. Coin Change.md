## Question
You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.  
  
Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.  
  
You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.  
  
**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
Output: 0
</pre>

Constraints:
* 1 <= coins.length <= 12
* 1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1
* 0 <= amount <= 104


## Thinking

✅ Approach: Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up)  
We use Dynamic Programming (DP) to build up solutions for each amount from 1 to amount, by finding the minimum coins required for each smaller sub-problem  

✅ How It Works  
We create a DP array dp[], where dp[i] represents the minimum coins required to make up amount i.  
We initialize dp[0] = 0 because zero coins are needed to make the amount 0.  
For all other amounts i, we:  
Start with dp[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE (representing an impossible case).  
For each coin in coins, we check if it can help form the amount i.  
If it can, we update dp[i] to the minimum coins needed so far.  

## Coding
### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        
        int[] dp = new int[amount+1];
        dp[0] = 0;

        for (int i=1; i<amount+1; i++)
        {
            dp[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

            for (int c: coins)
            {
                if (c <= i && dp[i-c] != Integer.MAX_VALUE)
                {
                    dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i-c] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[amount] == Integer.MAX_VALUE? -1 : dp[amount];
    }
}
```
