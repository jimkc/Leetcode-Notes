## Question
Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.  
  
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.  
  
**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: s = "bbbab"
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
</pre>

Constraints:
* 1 <= s.length <= 1000
* s consists only of lowercase English letters.


## Thinking
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/solutions/99101/straight-forward-java-dp-solution
Need to do dp from n-1 to 0 because our core logic is `dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2;` or `dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1]);`.

## Coding
Time: O(n^2). 
Space: O(n^2)
### Solution
```java
public class Solution {
    public int longestPalindromeSubseq(String s) {
        int[][] dp = new int[s.length()][s.length()];
        

        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            dp[i][i] = 1;
            for (int j = i+1; j < s.length(); j++) {
                // below is the core logic and why we need to do dp from n-1 to 0
                if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[0][s.length()-1];
    }
}
```
