## Question
A transaction is possibly invalid if:  
  
the amount exceeds $1000, or;  
if it occurs within (and including) 60 minutes of another transaction with the same name in a different city.  
You are given an array of strings transaction where transactions[i] consists of comma-separated values representing the name, time (in minutes), amount, and city of the transaction.  
  
Return a list of transactions that are possibly invalid. You may return the answer in any order.  

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: transactions = ["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,100,beijing"]
Output: ["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,100,beijing"]
Explanation: The first transaction is invalid because the second transaction occurs within a difference of 60 minutes, have the same name and is in a different city. Similarly the second one is invalid too.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: transactions = ["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,1200,mtv"]
Output: ["alice,50,1200,mtv"]
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
Input: transactions = ["alice,20,800,mtv","bob,50,1200,mtv"]
Output: ["bob,50,1200,mtv"]
</pre>


Constraints:
* transactions.length <= 1000
* Each transactions[i] takes the form "{name},{time},{amount},{city}"
* Each {name} and {city} consist of lowercase English letters, and have lengths between 1 and 10.
* Each {time} consist of digits, and represent an integer between 0 and 1000.
* Each {amount} consist of digits, and represent an integer between 0 and 2000.

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> invalidTransactions(String[] transactions) {
        Map<String, List<Transaction>> history = new HashMap<>();
        List<String> ans = new ArrayList<>();

        for (String t: transactions) {
            Transaction ta = new Transaction(t);
            history.putIfAbsent(ta.name, new ArrayList<>());
            history.get(ta.name).add(ta);
        }

        for (String t: transactions) {
            Transaction ta = new Transaction(t);
            if (!isValid(ta, history.get(ta.name))) {
                ans.add(t);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }

    private boolean isValid(Transaction t, List<Transaction> list) {
        if (t.amount > 1000) {
            return false;
        }

        for (Transaction ta: list) {
            if (Math.abs(t.time - ta.time) <= 60 && !ta.city.equals(t.city)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    class Transaction{
        String name;
        int time;
        int amount;
        String city;
        
        public Transaction(String t) {
            String[] data = t.split(",");
            name = data[0];
            time = Integer.parseInt(data[1]);
            amount = Integer.parseInt(data[2]);
            city = data[3];
        }
    }
}
