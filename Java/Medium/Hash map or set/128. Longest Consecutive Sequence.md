## Question
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.  
  
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.  

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]
Output: 3
</pre>

Constraints:  
* 0 <= nums.length <= 105
* -109 <= nums[i] <= 109

## Coding
Time: O(n) we remove traversed nums so go though all nums once.

Space: O(n)

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int n: nums)
        {
            set.add(n);
        }

        int longestStreak = 0;
        for (int n: nums)
        {
            // make sure n is the head of the streak
            if (!set.contains(n-1))
            {
                int currentStreak = 1;
                int currentNum = n;
                while(set.contains(currentNum+1))
                {
                    // remove as this number will be in the middle of a sequence.
                    set.remove(currentNum+1);
                    currentStreak+=1;
                    currentNum+=1;
                    
                }
                longestStreak = Math.max(currentStreak, longestStreak);
            }
        }
        return longestStreak;
    }
}
```
