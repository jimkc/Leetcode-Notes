## Question
A good meal is a meal that contains exactly two different food items with a sum of deliciousness equal to a power of two.  
  
You can pick any two different foods to make a good meal.  
  
Given an array of integers deliciousness where deliciousness[i] is the deliciousness of the ith item of food, return the number of different good meals you can make from this list modulo 109 + 7.  
  
Note that items with different indices are considered different even if they have the same deliciousness value.  
  
**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: deliciousness = [1,3,5,7,9]
Output: 4
Explanation: The good meals are (1,3), (1,7), (3,5) and, (7,9).
Their respective sums are 4, 8, 8, and 16, all of which are powers of 2.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: deliciousness = [1,1,1,3,3,3,7]
Output: 15
Explanation: The good meals are (1,1) with 3 ways, (1,3) with 9 ways, and (1,7) with 3 ways.
</pre>

Constraints:
* 1 <= deliciousness.length <= 105
* 0 <= deliciousness[i] <= 220

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    int mod = 1000000007;
    public int countPairs(int[] arr) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int n = arr.length;
        long res = 0;
        for (int num : arr) {
            int powerNum = 1;
            // constraint says the max is 2^20 for each num, so adding together max will be
            // 2^21
            for (int i = 0; i < 22; i++) {
                if (map.containsKey(powerNum - num)) {
                    res += map.get(powerNum - num);
                    // mentioned by question
                    res %= mod;
                }
                powerNum *= 2;
            }
            map.put(num, map.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }
        return (int) res;
    }
}
