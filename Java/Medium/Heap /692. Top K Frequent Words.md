## Question
Given an array of strings words and an integer k, return the k most frequent strings.  
  
Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.  
  
**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
Output: ["i","love"]
Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4
Output: ["the","is","sunny","day"]
Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
</pre>

Constraints:  
* 1 <= words.length <= 500
* 1 <= words[i].length <= 10
* words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
* k is in the range [1, The number of unique words[i]]

## Coding
Time: O(nlogk), k is the unique words

Space: O(n)

### Solution 
```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> topKFrequent(String[] words, int k) {
        
        Map<String, Integer> cnt = new HashMap<>();

        for (String w: words)
        {
            cnt.put(w, cnt.getOrDefault(w, 0) + 1);
        }

        PriorityQueue<String> maxheap = new PriorityQueue<>(
            new Comparator<String>(){
                @Override
                public int compare(String a, String b)
                {
                    int freqA = cnt.getOrDefault(a, 0);
                    int freqB = cnt.getOrDefault(b, 0);
                    if (freqA != freqB)
                    {
                        return freqB - freqA;
                    }

                    return a.compareTo(b);
                }
            }
        );

        maxheap.addAll(cnt.keySet());

        List<String> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        int i=0;
        while(i<k)
        {
            ans.add(maxheap.poll());
            i++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
