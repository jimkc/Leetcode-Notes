## Question
Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the reversed list.
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/description/

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
Output: [5]
</pre>

## Thought Process
1. We create a dummy node to handle cases where the left position is the first node in the original list.
2. We set the prev node to the dummy node and the curr node to the head of the list.
3. We iterate through the list until we reach the left position, moving both prev and curr accordingly.
4. We keep track of the start node (node before the reversed sublist) and the end node (node at the right position).
5. We reverse the sublist by iteratively reversing the pointers of the nodes within the sublist.
6. After the sublist is reversed, we connect the start node to the new head of the reversed sublist (prev) and the end node to the node that comes after the sublist (curr).
7. Finally, we return the modified list by accessing the next node of the dummy node.

Note: The ListNode class is assumed to be already defined with the appropriate structure as provided in the code snippet.

### Solution
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseBetween(ListNode head, int left, int right) {
        if (head == null) return null;
        if (left == right) return head;

        final ListNode dummy = new ListNode();
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode prev = dummy;
        ListNode curr = head;

        for (int i=1; i<left; i++)
        {
            prev = curr;
            curr = curr.next;
        }

        ListNode start = prev; // start of the reversed list
        ListNode end = curr; // end of the reversed list

        // prev -> curr -> next to node <- prev <- curr  next
        // reverse the sublist
        for (int i=left; i<= right; i++)
        {
            ListNode next = curr.next;
            curr.next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = next;
        }

        // point the start and end to the reversed list 
        start.next = prev; // connect start to the reversed list head
        end.next = curr; // connect end to the reversed list end 

        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```
