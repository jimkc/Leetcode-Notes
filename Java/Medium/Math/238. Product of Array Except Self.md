## Question
Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
</pre>


Constraints:

    2 <= nums.length <= 105
    -30 <= nums[i] <= 30
    The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

Follow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

## Thinking
Given numbers [2, 3, 4, 5], regarding the third number 4,   
the product of array except 4 is 2*3*5 which consists of two parts: left 2*3 and right 5.   
The product is left*right. We can get lefts and rights:

```
Numbers:     2    3    4     5
Lefts:            2  2*3 2*3*4
Rights:  3*4*5  4*5    5   
```

Let’s fill the empty with 1:

```
Numbers:     2    3    4     5
Lefts:       1    2  2*3 2*3*4
Rights:  3*4*5  4*5    5     1
```

We can calculate lefts and rights in 2 loops. The time complexity is O(n).  
We store lefts in result array. If we allocate a new array for rights. The space complexity is O(n).   
To make it O(1), we just need to store it in a variable which is right in @lycjava3’s code.

## Coding
Time: O(n)

Space: O(1)

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] results = new int[n];

        // Calculate lefts and store in res.
        int left = 1;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
        {
            if(i > 0)
            {
                left = left * nums[i-1];
            }
            results[i] = left;
        }

        // Calculate rights and the product from the end of the array.
        int right = 1;
        for(int i = n-1; i>=0; i--)
        {
            if(i < n-1)
            {
                right = right*nums[i+1];
            }
            results[i]*=right;
        }
        return results;
    }
}
```
