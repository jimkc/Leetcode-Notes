## Question
You are given an array of CPU tasks, each labeled with a letter from A to Z, and a number n. Each CPU interval can be idle or allow the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: there has to be a gap of at least n intervals between two tasks with the same label.  
  
Return the minimum number of CPU intervals required to complete all tasks.  
  
**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2

Output: 8

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.

After completing task A, you must wait two intervals before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th interval, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1

Output: 6

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.

With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3

Output: 10

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B.

There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.
</pre>

Constraints:
* 1 <= tasks.length <= 104
* tasks[i] is an uppercase English letter.
* 0 <= n <= 100

## Thinking
The idea is to use minInterval calculation to calculate the total rounds needed 
  
This happens when:  

1. n is large: A large n creates significant "idle" slots between repetitions of the most frequent task. It becomes difficult to fill all these slots with other unique tasks.
2. maxFrequency is much higher than other task frequencies, or there aren't many unique task types: This means you'll quickly run out of other distinct tasks to fill the cooldown slots of the maxFrequency task, forcing true idle periods.



## Coding
Time: O(n)  
Space: O(n)
### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int leastInterval(char[] tasks, int n) {
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (char t: tasks) {
            map.put(t, map.getOrDefault(t, 0)+1);
        }

        int maxFreq=0;
        for (int f: map.values()) {
            maxFreq = Math.max(maxFreq, f);
        }

        int countMaxFreqTasks = 0;
        for (int f: map.values()) {
            if (f == maxFreq) {
                countMaxFreqTasks+=1;
            }
        }

        // The idea is to arrange the most frequent tasks first.
        // For example, if maxFrequency is 3 and n is 2, for task A:
        // A _ _ A _ _ A
        // The length of this pattern is (maxFrequency - 1) * (n + 1).
        // Then we add the tasks that have the maximum frequency (e.g., if B also has maxFrequency):
        // A B _ A B _ A B
        // The 'countMaxFrequencyTasks' adds these final tasks to the last cycle.
        
        int minInterval = (maxFreq - 1) * (n + 1) + countMaxFreqTasks;
         
        // This handles cases where n is small, and there are enough different tasks to fill the idle slots.
        //The minIntervals formula primarily focuses on the "bottleneck" created by the most frequent task 
        return Math.max(minInterval, tasks.length);
    }
}
