## Question
Given an array of integers nums and an integer limit, return the size of the longest non-empty subarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to limit.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [8,2,4,7], limit = 4
Output: 2 
Explanation: All subarrays are: 
[8] with maximum absolute diff |8-8| = 0 <= 4.
[8,2] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4. 
[8,2,4] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[8,2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[2] with maximum absolute diff |2-2| = 0 <= 4.
[2,4] with maximum absolute diff |2-4| = 2 <= 4.
[2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |2-7| = 5 > 4.
[4] with maximum absolute diff |4-4| = 0 <= 4.
[4,7] with maximum absolute diff |4-7| = 3 <= 4.
[7] with maximum absolute diff |7-7| = 0 <= 4. 
Therefore, the size of the longest subarray is 2.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [10,1,2,4,7,2], limit = 5
Output: 4 
Explanation: The subarray [2,4,7,2] is the longest since the maximum absolute diff is |2-7| = 5 <= 5.
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [4,2,2,2,4,4,2,2], limit = 0
Output: 3
</pre>

Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length <= 105
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 109
* 0 <= limit <= 109

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestSubarray(int[] nums, int limit) {
        int l = 0;
        // max queue for l~r array order from large to small
        LinkedList<Integer> maxQueue = new LinkedList<>();
        // min queue for l~r array order from small to large
        LinkedList<Integer> minQueue = new LinkedList<>();
        
        int ans = 1;
        for (int r = 0; r <nums.length; r++) {
            // maintain queue order from large to small
            while (!maxQueue.isEmpty() && nums[r] > maxQueue.peekLast()) {
                maxQueue.pollLast();
            }
            maxQueue.addLast(nums[r]);

            // maintain queeu order from small to large
            while(!minQueue.isEmpty() && nums[r] < minQueue.peekLast()) {
                minQueue.pollLast();
            }
            minQueue.addLast(nums[r]);

            // shrink left window if current l~r array max-min > limit
            while(maxQueue.peekFirst() - minQueue.peekFirst() > limit) {
                // remove the element in the left
                if (maxQueue.peekFirst() == nums[l]) maxQueue.pollFirst();
                if (minQueue.peekFirst() == nums[l]) minQueue.pollFirst();
                l++;
            }
            ans = Math.max(ans, r-l+1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
