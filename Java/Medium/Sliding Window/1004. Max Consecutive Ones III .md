## Question
Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.

https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/description/

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
</pre>

Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 105
    nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
    0 <= k <= nums.length




## Thinking
The size of the window is never decreased as we are only moving the start pointer when the zeros in the window is larger than k.  
And we increase the end each round.


## Coding
Time: O(n)

Space: O(1)

### Solution 1 Greedy
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestOnes(int[] nums, int k) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = 0;
        int zeros = 0;

        while (end < nums.length)
        {
            if (nums[end] == 0)
            {
                zeros++;
            }
            // increase the window size by 1
            end++;

            if (zeros > k)
            {
                if (nums[start] == 0)
                {
                    zeros--;
                }
                // decrease the window size by 1, because we increased 1 earlier 
                // and we can't flip all the zeros, so need to restore the window size
                start++;
            }
        }
        // we are maintaining the max window size as end -start
        return end-start;
    }
}
```
