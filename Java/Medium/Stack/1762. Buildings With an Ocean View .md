## Question
There are n buildings in a line. You are given an integer array heights of size n that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.

The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a smaller height.

Return a list of indices (0-indexed) of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: heights = [4,2,3,1]
Output: [0,2,3]
Explanation: Building 1 (0-indexed) does not have an ocean view because building 2 is taller.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: heights = [4,3,2,1]
Output: [0,1,2,3]
Explanation: All the buildings have an ocean view.
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
Input: heights = [1,3,2,4]
Output: [3]
Explanation: Only building 3 has an ocean view.
</pre>

Constraints:

    1 <= heights.length <= 105
    1 <= heights[i] <= 109

## Coding
Time: O(n) 

Space: O(n)

### Solution (Assume we can only traverse from left to right)
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findBuildings(int[] heights) {
        final Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        final Stack<Integer> indexStack = new Stack<>();

        for (int i=0; i<heights.length; i++)
        {
            if (stack.isEmpty())
            {
                stack.push(heights[i]);
                indexStack.push(i);
            }
            else
            {
                while((!stack.isEmpty()) && heights[i] >= stack.peek())
                {
                    stack.pop();
                    indexStack.pop();
                }
                stack.push(heights[i]);
                indexStack.push(i);
            }
        }


        int n = stack.size();
        int[] ans = new int[n];

        if (n > 0)
        {
            for (int i=n-1; i>=0; i--)
            {
                ans[i] = indexStack.pop();
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```
