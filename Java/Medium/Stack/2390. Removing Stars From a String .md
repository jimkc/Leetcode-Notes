## Question
You are given a string s, which contains stars *.

In one operation, you can:

    Choose a star in s.
    Remove the closest non-star character to its left, as well as remove the star itself.

Return the string after all stars have been removed.

Note:

    The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.
    It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: s = "leet**cod*e"
Output: "lecoe"
Explanation: Performing the removals from left to right:
- The closest character to the 1st star is 't' in "leet**cod*e". s becomes "lee*cod*e".
- The closest character to the 2nd star is 'e' in "lee*cod*e". s becomes "lecod*e".
- The closest character to the 3rd star is 'd' in "lecod*e". s becomes "lecoe".
There are no more stars, so we return "lecoe".
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: s = "erase*****"
Output: ""
Explanation: The entire string is removed, so we return an empty string.
</pre>

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 105
    s consists of lowercase English letters and stars *.
    The operation above can be performed on s.

### Solution 1 StringBuilder
```java
class Solution {
    public String removeStars(String s) {
        if (s.length() == 1)
        {
            if (s.charAt(0) == '*')
            {
                return "";
            }
            else
            {
                return s;
            }
        }

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)
        {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            if (c == '*')
            {
                // pop the last char
                sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);
            }
            else
            {
                sb.append(c);
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

### Solution 2 Stack
```java
class Solution {
    public String removeStars(String l) {
        // Create a new stack to keep track of characters encountered so far
        Stack<Character> s = new Stack<>();
        
        // Iterate over each character in the input string
        for (char c : l.toCharArray()) {
            // If the current character is a star, remove the topmost character from the stack
            if (c == '*') {
                s.pop();
            }
            // If the current character is not a star, add it to the stack
            else {
                s.push(c);
            }
        }
        
        // Create a new StringBuilder to store the characters in the stack
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        
        // Iterate over each character in the stack and append it to the StringBuilder
        for (char c : s) {
            sb.append(c);
        }
        
        // Convert the StringBuilder to a string and return it as the output
        return sb.toString();
    }
}

```
