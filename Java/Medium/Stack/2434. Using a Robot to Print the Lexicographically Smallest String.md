## Question
You are given a string s and a robot that currently holds an empty string t. Apply one of the following operations until s and t are both empty:  
  
Remove the first character of a string s and give it to the robot. The robot will append this character to the string t.  
Remove the last character of a string t and give it to the robot. The robot will write this character on paper.  
Return the lexicographically smallest string that can be written on the paper.  
  
**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: s = "zza"
Output: "azz"
Explanation: Let p denote the written string.
Initially p="", s="zza", t="".
Perform first operation three times p="", s="", t="zza".
Perform second operation three times p="azz", s="", t="".
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: s = "bac"
Output: "abc"
Explanation: Let p denote the written string.
Perform first operation twice p="", s="c", t="ba". 
Perform second operation twice p="ab", s="c", t="". 
Perform first operation p="ab", s="", t="c". 
Perform second operation p="abc", s="", t="".
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
Input: s = "bdda"
Output: "addb"
Explanation: Let p denote the written string.
Initially p="", s="bdda", t="".
Perform first operation four times p="", s="", t="bdda".
Perform second operation four times p="addb", s="", t="".
</pre>

Constraints:
* 1 <= s.length <= 105
* s consists of only English lowercase letters.

## Thinking
To get the lexicographically smallest string using a robot and a stack, the robot can:  
  
Push the next character from string s to the stack.  
Pop from the stack and add it to the result only when the top is less than or equal to the smallest character left in s.  
The idea is to keep track of the smallest character left and make decisions based on that.  
  
## Coding
Time: O(n)  
Space: O(1).  
### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public String robotWithString(String s) {
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        // the t robot
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();

        for (int i=0; i<s.length(); i++) {
            freq[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i=0; i<s.length(); i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);

            stack.push(c);
            freq[c - 'a']--;

            while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() <= getSmallestChar(freq)) {
                sb.append(stack.pop());
            }
        }

        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            sb.append(stack.pop());
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }

    private char getSmallestChar(int[] freq) {
        for (int i=0; i<freq.length; i++) {
            if (freq[i] > 0) {
                return (char) ('a' + i);
            }
        }
        return 'a';
    }
}
```
