## Question
We are given an array asteroids of integers representing asteroids in a row.

For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: asteroids = [5,10,-5]
Output: [5,10]
Explanation: The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10. The 5 and 10 never collide.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: asteroids = [8,-8]
Output: []
Explanation: The 8 and -8 collide exploding each other.
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
Input: asteroids = [10,2,-5]
Output: [10]
Explanation: The 2 and -5 collide resulting in -5. The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.
</pre>

Constraints:

    2 <= asteroids.length <= 104
    -1000 <= asteroids[i] <= 1000
    asteroids[i] != 0





## Thinking
The idea is to use a stack to simulate the collision process. For each asteroid, we check whether it will collide with the previous asteroid(s) already in the stack.  


1. If the current asteroid is positive, it will not collide with any previous asteroids, so we simply push it onto the stack.
2. If the current asteroid is negative, it will collide with the previous asteroid(s) already in the stack:
    a. If the top of the stack is negative, both asteroids will pass each other and keep moving in their respective directions. So, we push the current asteroid onto the stack.
    b. If the top of the stack is positive and has a greater magnitude than the current asteroid, the current asteroid will be destroyed, so we do nothing.
    c. If the top of the stack is positive and has a smaller magnitude than the current asteroid, the top of the stack will be destroyed, so we pop it and repeat the collision check with the new top of the stack (if any).
3. At the end, we return the remaining asteroids in the stack from bottom to top, which represent the surviving asteroids.

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] asteroidCollision(int[] asteroids) {
        Stack<Integer> s = new Stack<>();

        for (int a: asteroids)
        {
            if (s.isEmpty() || a > 0)
            {
                // If the stack is empty or the current asteroid is moving right (positive),
                // just push it onto the stack.
                s.push(a);
            }
            else
            {
                // if the item in the left are < 0 they will never collide with others, so no
                // need to check
                // The current asteroid is moving left (negative).
                // Check for collisions with asteroids moving right (positive) on the stack.
                while(!s.isEmpty() && s.peek() > 0 && s.peek() < Math.abs(a))
                {
                    s.pop();
                }
                if (!s.isEmpty() && s.peek() > 0 && s.peek() == Math.abs(a)) {
                    s.pop();
                } else {
                    if (s.isEmpty() || s.peek() < 0) {
                        s.push(a);
                    }
                }

            }
        }
        // Convert the stack to an array to get the final state of asteroids.
        int[] result = new int[s.size()];
        for (int i = result.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            result[i] = s.pop();
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
