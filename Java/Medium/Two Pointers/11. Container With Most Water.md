## Question
YYou are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).  

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.  

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.  

Notice that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
</pre>

Constraints:   
1. n == height.length  
2. 2 <= n <= 105  
3. 0 <= height[i] <= 104  

## Thinking
Move the pointers for the shorter pointer, because moving higher pointer will not increase the water level it is fixed with the shorter ones.

## Coding
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1) 

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int i = 0, j = height.length-1;
        
        int ans = 0;
        while (i < j)
        {
            int waterLevel = Math.min(height[i], height[j]);
            int distance = j-i;
            ans = Math.max(ans, waterLevel * distance);

            if (height[i] < height[j])
            {
                i++;
            }
            else
            {
                j--;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
