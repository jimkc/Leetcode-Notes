## Question
A string can be abbreviated by replacing any number of non-adjacent, non-empty substrings with their lengths. The lengths should not have leading zeros.

For example, a string such as "substitution" could be abbreviated as (but not limited to):

    "s10n" ("s ubstitutio n")
    "sub4u4" ("sub stit u tion")
    "12" ("substitution")
    "su3i1u2on" ("su bst i t u ti on")
    "substitution" (no substrings replaced)

The following are not valid abbreviations:

    "s55n" ("s ubsti tutio n", the replaced substrings are adjacent)
    "s010n" (has leading zeros)
    "s0ubstitution" (replaces an empty substring)

Given a string word and an abbreviation abbr, return whether the string matches the given abbreviation.

A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: word = "internationalization", abbr = "i12iz4n"
Output: true
Explanation: The word "internationalization" can be abbreviated as "i12iz4n" ("i nternational iz atio n").
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: word = "apple", abbr = "a2e"
Output: false
Explanation: The word "apple" cannot be abbreviated as "a2e".
</pre>


Constraints:

    1 <= word.length <= 20
    word consists of only lowercase English letters.
    1 <= abbr.length <= 10
    abbr consists of lowercase English letters and digits.
    All the integers in abbr will fit in a 32-bit integer.

Time: O(n)

### Solution (Assume we can only traverse from left to right)
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean validWordAbbreviation(String word, String abbr) {
        if (word == null || abbr == null)
        {
            return false;
        }

        int wlen = word.length();
        int alen = abbr.length();

        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        while(i < wlen && j < alen)
        {
            if (word.charAt(i) == abbr.charAt(j))
            {
                i++;
                j++;
                continue;
            }

            // char does not match, check invalid conditions
            if (abbr.charAt(j) == '0' || !Character.isDigit(abbr.charAt(j)))
            {
                return false;
            }

            // now we know char in abbr is a digit
            int num = 0;
            while(j<alen && Character.isDigit(abbr.charAt(j)))
            {
                // cant use Interger.valueOf as it is char
                num = num*10 + (abbr.charAt(j) - '0');
                j++;
            }

            i += num;
        }
        return i == wlen && j == alen;
    }
}
```
