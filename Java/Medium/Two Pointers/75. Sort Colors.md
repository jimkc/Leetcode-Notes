## Question
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.  
  
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.  
  
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.  
    
**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
</pre>

Constraints:
* n == nums.length
* 1 <= n <= 300
* nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.

## Thinking
Use three pointer.

## Coding
Time: O(n)  
Space: O(1)
### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;

        int left=0, right=n-1;
        int i = 0;
        while (i <= right) {
            // we start from left to right, so i will not switch with left that has value 2
            // because left will always have value that i already go through
            // if it is 2 i already swap with the right pointer.
            if (nums[i] == 0) {
                // left will be 1
                swap(i, left, nums);
                left++;
                i++;
            } else if (nums[i] == 2) {
                swap(i, right, nums);
                right--;
            } else {
                // already 1
                i++;
            }
            
        }
    }

    private void swap(int i, int j, int[] nums) {
        int tmp = nums[i];
        nums[i] = nums[j];
        nums[j] = tmp;
    }
}
```
