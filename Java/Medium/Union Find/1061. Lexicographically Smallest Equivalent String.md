## Question
You are given two strings of the same length s1 and s2 and a string baseStr.  
  
We say s1[i] and s2[i] are equivalent characters.  
  
For example, if s1 = "abc" and s2 = "cde", then we have 'a' == 'c', 'b' == 'd', and 'c' == 'e'.  
Equivalent characters follow the usual rules of any equivalence relation:  
  
Reflexivity: 'a' == 'a'.  
Symmetry: 'a' == 'b' implies 'b' == 'a'.  
Transitivity: 'a' == 'b' and 'b' == 'c' implies 'a' == 'c'.  
For example, given the equivalency information from s1 = "abc" and s2 = "cde", "acd" and "aab" are equivalent strings of baseStr = "eed", and "aab" is the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr.  
  
Return the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr by using the equivalency information from s1 and s2.  
    
**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: s1 = "parker", s2 = "morris", baseStr = "parser"
Output: "makkek"
Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can group their characters as [m,p], [a,o], [k,r,s], [e,i].
The characters in each group are equivalent and sorted in lexicographical order.
So the answer is "makkek".
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: s1 = "hello", s2 = "world", baseStr = "hold"
Output: "hdld"
Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can group their characters as [h,w], [d,e,o], [l,r].
So only the second letter 'o' in baseStr is changed to 'd', the answer is "hdld".
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
Input: s1 = "leetcode", s2 = "programs", baseStr = "sourcecode"
Output: "aauaaaaada"
Explanation: We group the equivalent characters in s1 and s2 as [a,o,e,r,s,c], [l,p], [g,t] and [d,m], thus all letters in baseStr except 'u' and 'd' are transformed to 'a', the answer is "aauaaaaada".
</pre>

Constraints:
* 1 <= s1.length, s2.length, baseStr <= 1000
* s1.length == s2.length
* s1, s2, and baseStr consist of lowercase English letters.

## Thinking

## Coding
Time: O(n+m), union find at most 26n. m is the length of base str.  
Space: O(1).  
### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public String smallestEquivalentString(String s1, String s2, String baseStr) {
        int[] groups = new int[26];
        for (int i=0; i<26; i++) {
            groups[i] = i;
        }

        for (int i=0; i<s1.length(); i++) {
            int a = s1.charAt(i) - 'a';
            int b = s2.charAt(i) - 'a';
            int groupA = unionFind(a, groups);
            int groupB = unionFind(b, groups);

            if (groupA < groupB) {
                groups[groupB] = groupA;
            } else {
                groups[groupA] = groupB;
            }
        }

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i=0; i<baseStr.length(); i++) {
            int idx = baseStr.charAt(i) - 'a';
            char newChar = (char)('a' + unionFind(idx, groups));
            sb.append(newChar);
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }

    private int unionFind(int x, int[] groups) {
        if (groups[x] != x) {
            groups[x] = unionFind(groups[x], groups);
        }
        return groups[x];
    }
}
```
