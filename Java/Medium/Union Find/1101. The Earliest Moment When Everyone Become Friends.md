## Question
There are n people in a social group labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given an array logs where `logs[i] = [timestampi, xi, yi]` indicates that `xi` and `yi` will be friends at the time timestamp `i`.  
  
Friendship is symmetric. That means if a is friends with b, then b is friends with a. Also, person a is acquainted with a person b if a is friends with b, or a is a friend of someone acquainted with b.  
  
Return the earliest time for which every person became acquainted with every other person. If there is no such earliest time, return -1.  

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: logs = [[20190101,0,1],[20190104,3,4],[20190107,2,3],[20190211,1,5],[20190224,2,4],[20190301,0,3],[20190312,1,2],[20190322,4,5]], n = 6
Output: 20190301
Explanation: 
The first event occurs at timestamp = 20190101, and after 0 and 1 become friends, we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3], [4], [5].
The second event occurs at timestamp = 20190104, and after 3 and 4 become friends, we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3,4], [5].
The third event occurs at timestamp = 20190107, and after 2 and 3 become friends, we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2,3,4], [5].
The fourth event occurs at timestamp = 20190211, and after 1 and 5 become friends, we have the following friendship groups [0,1,5], [2,3,4].
The fifth event occurs at timestamp = 20190224, and as 2 and 4 are already friends, nothing happens.
The sixth event occurs at timestamp = 20190301, and after 0 and 3 become friends, we all become friends.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: logs = [[0,2,0],[1,0,1],[3,0,3],[4,1,2],[7,3,1]], n = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: At timestamp = 3, all the persons (i.e., 0, 1, 2, and 3) become friends.
