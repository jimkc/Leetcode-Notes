## Question
You are given an array nums of length n. You are also given an integer k.  
  
You perform the following operation on nums once:  
  
* Select a subarray nums[i..j] where 0 <= i <= j <= n - 1.  
* Select an integer x and add x to all the elements in nums[i..j].  
Find the maximum frequency of the value k after the operation.  

**Example 1:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6], k = 1
Output: 2

Explanation:
After adding -5 to nums[2..5], 1 has a frequency of 2 in [1, 2, -2, -1, 0, 1].
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
Input: nums = [10,2,3,4,5,5,4,3,2,2], k = 10
Output: 4

Explanation:
After adding 8 to nums[1..9], 10 has a frequency of 4 in [10, 10, 11, 12, 13, 13, 12, 11, 10, 10].
</pre>

Constraints:
* 1 <= n == nums.length <= 105
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 50
* 1 <= k <= 50

## Coding

### Solution
```java

class Solution {
    public static int solve(int[] nums, int k) {
        int k_freq = 0;
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        // count all numbers frequency
        for (int i : nums) {
            map.put(i, map.getOrDefault(i, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        if (map.containsKey(k)) {
            k_freq += map.get(k);
        }
        
        int maxIncrease = 0;
        
        // constraints says number is from 1-50, so we try all the possible occurence number
        for (int n = 1; n <= 50; n++) {
            // no need to try k itself
            if (n == k) continue;            
            int curr_sum = 0;
            int temp_maxIncrease = 0;
            // this part is counting the max number of k it can increase after applying x
            for (int num : nums) {
                // the subarray can move the largest freq num to k but at the same time 
                // the original number that is k in the subarray gets removed.
                if (num == n) {
                    curr_sum += 1; // add
                } else if (num == k) {
                    curr_sum -= 1;  //remove
                } 

                // if we found < 0 means that we can discard the previous subarrays and 
                // start fresh counts from next number
                if (curr_sum < 0) {
                    curr_sum = 0;
                }

                // curr_sum is the total increase of k we can get after applying x
                if (curr_sum > temp_maxIncrease) {
                    temp_maxIncrease = curr_sum;
                }
            }

            if (temp_maxIncrease > maxIncrease) {
                maxIncrease = temp_maxIncrease;
            }
        }

        int maxfreq = k_freq + maxIncrease;
        return maxfreq;
    }

    public int maxFrequency(int[] nums, int k) {
        return solve(nums, k);
    }
}
```

### Optimized solution
Instead of trying all the numbers we can use an array to remeber the frequency from the start to the current position. 
Same as Kadane's algorithm where we always restart manually with loop,  we use math.Max() to choose the current num's freq (which means we chose num over k) or we choose k which means we did not add x to the subarray.
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxFrequency(int[] nums, int k) {
        int maxFreq = 0;
        int[] count = new int[51];

        for (int num: nums) {
            count[num] = Math.max(count[num], count[k]) + 1;
            // if the above line k has more num, below line count[num] - count[k] will be 0
            // on the other hand if num has more, the diff will be the additional k will increase from the subarray
            maxFreq = Math.max(count[num] - count[k], maxFreq);
        }

        return count[k] + maxFreq;

    }
}
```
