## Question
You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2.<br>

The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.

**Example :**
<pre>
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2].
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
    For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.


Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4].
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 2 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 4 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
</pre>

Note:<br>
All elements in nums1 and nums2 are unique.<br>
The length of both nums1 and nums2 would not exceed 1000.<br>


## Thinking
Build the stack to find next greater number for every num in nums2 first.

## Coding
Time: O(m+n);n for nums2 m for nums1, the second loop in loop1 only pops n elements in total, so its O(n) also . </br>
Space: O(m+n).
```python3
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElement(self, nums1, nums2):
        """
        :type nums1: List[int]
        :type nums2: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        ans = []
        tmp = []
        next_greater = {}
        
        # Use stack to record all possible next greater
        for item in nums2:
            if len(tmp) == 0:
                tmp.append(item)
            else:
                for i in range(len(tmp)-1,-1,-1):
                    if item > tmp[-1]:
                        next_greater[tmp[-1]] = item
                        tmp.pop()
                    else: 
                        break 
                tmp.append(item) # If we didnt find any next greater to add in dic, we add it in the top of the stack
                
        for n in nums1:
            if n in next_greater:
                ans.append(next_greater[n])
            else:
                ans.append(-1)
        return ans
```
