## Question
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.<br>

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

**Example :**
<pre>
Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]

        _______6______
       /              \
    ___2__          ___8__
   /      \        /      \
   0      _4       7       9
         /  \
         3   5
         

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.



Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself 
             according to the LCA definition.

Note:

All of the nodes' values will be unique.
p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.
## Thinking
The first parent that appears between p and q will be the target, beacause it is a BST.

## Coding
Time: O(n);</br>
Space: O(n).
```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
        while root:
            if max(p.val, q.val) < root.val:
                root = root.left
            elif min(p.val, q.val) > root.val:
                root = root.right
            else:
                return root
        return None

```
